Follow-up on Pending Actions and Updates for WebApp Development
Dear Proliance Team,
We hope this message finds you well. 
We sincerely appreciate the effort you’ve put into the web application so far. As we move forward, we’d like to gently highlight a few pending action points from our last meeting and reviews that require your attention. Ensuring timely implementation of these tasks will help us keep the project on track.
Pending Actions:
  Domain Testing: Could we kindly get an update on the www. domain? Testing was expected to begin today.
Postcode Implementation: A response was anticipated by the end of yesterday. Kindly confirm the status.
Trade Search Feature: The search should narrow down results to a specific postcode or area, showing premium users first. A video sample has been added to the master document.
Artisan Sign-Up Page Issues:


(i) Categories are not reflecting after selection.
(ii) Errors are occurring during submission, particularly for categories and passwords. The password format requirements are yet to be updated
"Leave a Review" Page Update: Kindly change "Which trade would you like to review" to "Which artisan would you like to review."  From the customer’s page.
Submission Errors: Clicking "Submit" (e.g., Artisan Login) does not seem to post the required data.
Floating Box Update: On the Artisan signup page, change "See our prices" to "Call now."
Customer Login: Kindly include a field for either email or phone number. Additionally:
(i) The API for Mr. Michael to register (as it’s a paid service) – please provide an ETA.
(ii) I didn’t receive an email verification code during testing. Kindly confirm the status of this functionality as the customer signup page sample is on the master document.
Artisan Signup Page: Kindly remove the map feature as discussed in the last 3 meetings.
“Remember Me” Functionality for passwords: This hasn’t been implemented yet.



Additional Fields:
(i) Add a field for time availability and an optional box for the cost of services/skills after the "Skill" section on the Artisan signup page. These fields should reflect on their profile.
Step-by-Step Guide: A detailed guide to the Artisan profile setup (from signup) has been included in the review section of the master document.
OTP Implementation: This is still pending.
Revised Timelines: We are yet to receive an updated project timeline as noted yesterday (January 9)
Additional Requests:
Kindly let us know if there’s anything you need from the Simul team to help streamline the workflow and speedup the progress.
Could updates be shared with us each time a task is completed or implemented on the web app?
We trust your expertise and value your partnership in this project. Kindly prioritize the tasks as discussed, and we’re happy to assist in any way possible to ensure a smooth workflow.
Looking forward to your updates soon.
Warm regards,
Onyinyechi Kalu
Project Manager
